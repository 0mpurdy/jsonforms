# Roadmap

This roadmap defines our current view on how we will continue with the development of JSON Forms on a very coarse-grained level and is subject to change at any time:

H1/2018:
 * Improved Angular Support
 
H2/2018:
 * Renderer for Ionic
 * Tooling: JSON Forms-based editor for JSON Schemata
 * Tooling: JSON Forms-based reflective editor for JSON data based on a JSON Schema
