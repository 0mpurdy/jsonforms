# Roadmap

This roadmap defines our current view on how we will continue with the development of JSON Forms on a very coarse-grained level and is subject to change at any time:

H2/2020
 * Separation of core components and add-ons
 * JSON schema and UI schema editor


H1/2021
 * Strict application of semantic versioning
 * Eclipse Theia Integration of a JSONForms-based Editor
